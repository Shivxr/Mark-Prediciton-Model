# Mark-Prediciton-Model
This is a simple Heuristic ML model that uses a simple thumb approach for the prediction of final exam marks by this model made with Emphirical Analysis with various different Inputs and Boost factors.
# Boost Factor
This is used for the determination of the predicted marks , which is very crucial since inter-school examination results and final exam result vary upon a par.This boost factor is determined the amount of boost a student can get in their final exam marks.
# Features
1.Simple Web-Interface

2.Plotly for Graph

3.Simple heuristic model formula based calculation

4.College Suggestions (Chennai) according to the predicited Cut-off

Compared to Linear Regression and various Regression models,This model tends to be more accurate and needs lesser computation for the prediction.This performs very well with smaller data where other regression models struggle in computing lesser data based prediction.
